# Satvic
Satvic means pure.I have Designed a home page of a website which is developed for supporting womens of some village to sell their hand mades traditional clay products. As we know now a days in every house steel and aluminium cookware are used but earthen pots or clay cookware offer several benefits over steel and aliuminium cookware.As clay cookware are free from harmful chemicals or toxins unlike some metal cookware that may leach into food. So all the Clay made Cookwares are available in this Website for the Users.Clay is also used for making Home decoritive items.Home decor items are also available in the website. So it is not a functional website I have just designed the Home page using HTML and CSS. For using different icons in the page i have linked the font awesome library which is present in the cdnjs website which provide different libraries. cdn means content delivery network.
Hence by using different featurs of HTML and CSS i have successfully developed the Home page of Satvic.com.
